# SQL Queries
 
This repository contains a collection of complex and advanced SQL queries that I have designed and used for diverse purposes. These queries demonstrate my mastery of SQL and highlight my ability to solve problems with complex data.

Please note that all column, table, and schema names have been altered to avoid compromising sensitive information for any reason.

**Note:** If you find these complex SQL queries useful, don't forget to give the repository a star (ðŸŒŸ) to show your appreciation!

Happy querying! ðŸš€
